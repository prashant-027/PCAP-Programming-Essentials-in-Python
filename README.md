# PCAP-Programming-Essentials-in-Python
PCAP: Programming Essentials in Python (short form: Python Essentials) is a two-course series that covers all the basics of programming in Python, as well as general computer programming concepts and techniques, and the object-oriented approach.
The Python Essentials course series is divided into two parts:

Python Essentials 1 (PE1): BASICS, consisting of four modules;
Python Essentials 2 (PE2): INTERMEDIATE, consisting of four modules.
Each student has access to hands-on practice materials, labs, quizzes, and tests to learn how to utilize the skills and knowledge gained on the course and interact with some real-life programming tasks and situations.

Students who complete the course will be able to accomplish coding tasks related to the basics of programming in the Python language, and to understand the fundamental notions and techniques used in object-oriented programming.

Furthermore, they will be ready to attempt the following qualifications:

PCEP - Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer (after completing Python Essentials 1)
